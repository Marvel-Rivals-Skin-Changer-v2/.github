## 💡 What Is the Skin Changer?

The **Marvel Rivals Skin Changer** is a client-side cosmetic mod that lets you replace default hero skins with **any other outfit or style**, even ones that aren’t released yet 👀

While it doesn’t change the server-side appearance (unless synced with private lobbies or supported mods), **you’ll see yourself fully transformed** in your own game. Some builds even allow synced skin sharing in private/custom modes 👑
